Reusable elements that I have built or I am still in the process of building.

Utilizing Bootstrap and jQuery, these elements are being pulled in through a CDN at current, if the elements are used on a live site I would download the bootstrap.min and jQuery.min files and reference them directly.

Projects so far:
- PHP Contact form (PHP/JS/HTML using jQuery/Bootstrap)
- PHP custom plugin - acts as a custom code snippet injection (PHP)
